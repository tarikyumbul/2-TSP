# 2-TSP

2 Traveling Salespersons Problem algorithm. An Analysis of Algorithms school project. The aim of the program is to determine the shortest and most efficient route for 2 salespersons to travel all of the cities exactly once. C++ is preferred as the programming language because of its fast and efficient runtime.

The distance between two cities is defined as the Euclidian distance rounded to the nearest integer. The distance between two cities is computed as follows:

$$𝑐_1 = (𝑥_1, 𝑦_1)$$

$$𝑐_2 = (𝑥_2, 𝑦_2)$$

$$
d(c_1, c_2) = \text{round} \left( \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2} \right)
$$
